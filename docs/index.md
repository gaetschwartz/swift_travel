### I want to contribute but I don't know how

Here is a non-exhaustive list of things that could be improved with their respective subject.

**Note: Before trying to contribute, I strongly recommend you try using the app for a few so you get a general understanding of its structure and general functionning.**

#### 📱 UI
* Improve widgets, opr application design. To navigate through the app files, the folder structure is similar to the app navigation structure.
  - Example:
    * The widget that displays different routes in the route tab: `lib/tabs/routes/route_tile.dart`
    * The `pages` folder is for individual pages or pages not directly related to one of the 3 main tabs.


#### 🏳 Foreign language knowledge
* Add a new locale:
  * Read [ADDING-NEW-LOCALE.md](/docs/ADDING-NEW-LOCALE.md)

  ##### Supported locales:
  
     - [x] 🇬🇧 English 
     - [x] 🇫🇷 French
     - [x] 🇩🇪 German
     - [x] 🇮🇹 Italian (Probably innacurate) 
 
#### 🌍 Familiar with REST APIs ?
* Add your contry's public transport API:
  * Read [ADDING-NEW-API.md](/docs/ADDING-NEW-API.md)

  ##### Supported countries:

     - [x] 🇨🇭 Switzerland
     - [ ] 🇫🇷 France (40%)

#### 👨🏼‍💻 General good programming knowledge
* Improve the live-routing, mainly in the [`live-route` sub-package](/packages/live_route/lib/live_route.dart).

#### 🤖 Android 
* Implement the skeleton of a homescreen widget on Android.

#### 👨🏼‍🔬 Machine learning
